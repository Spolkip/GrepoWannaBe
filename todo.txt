- god towns for pve events per sometime to be able to get war points and resources and someone can conquer it(pvp), starts as strange ruins, becomes a city, solves a puzzle(random per person)


Later:
- if the city has the the whole island to be able to contruct a building that give buffs to the guild
- add heroes that can do skills on battle and also give buffs
- make it so you can conquer other cities
- add a battle simulation
- add troops into the city
- be able to surrender if you have one city and you are about to lose it 
Maybe: 
- add cities inside the island
- fix population and resource max

Bugs:
