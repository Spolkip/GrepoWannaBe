- add special buildings
- different troops for different nationalities
- add a request alliance system with options for each alliance to follow, like tarrifs, resources per some time etc


Later:
- if the city has the the whole island to be able to contruct a building that give buffs to the guild
- add heroes that can do skills on battle and also give buffs
- make it so you can conquer other cities
- add a battle simulation
- add troops into the city

Maybe: 
- add cities inside the island
