Later:
- if the city has the the whole island to be able to contruct a building that give buffs to the guild
- add heroes that can do skills on battle and also give buffs
- make it so you can conquer other cities
- be able to surrender if you have one city and you are about to lose it 

Maybe: 
- add cities inside the island
- fix population and resource max
- add presets for the workers

Bugs:
- Allince doesn't work on all cities
- storage 


Amin panel Bugs:
- when going to map view admin cheats get disable
- when putting resources it shows the amout you put for a second and then reverts itself to storage amount


Models:
- add a battle simulation
- add troops into the city

Indicator visual on both people
