Later:
- if the city has the the whole island to be able to contruct a building that give buffs to the guild
- add heroes that can do skills on battle and also give buffs
- make it so you can conquer other cities
- be able to surrender if you have one city and you are about to lose it 

Maybe: 
- add cities inside the island
- fix population and resource max
- add presets for the workers
Bugs:
- fix recruitment tooltip

Models:
- add a battle simulation
- add troops into the city
